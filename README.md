## Slides

Libraries and preliminary `HTML` file created with the R package `xaringan`, built on `remark.js`. The rest was (poorly) hard-coded the old-fashioned way by me. See [`references.pdf`](https://github.com/ledelaney/08-21-UCR/blob/main/extras/references.pdf) for references slide citations.

### Images

Originate from [RawPixel](https://www.rawpixel.com/category/53/public-domain), an incredible resource of public domain images. (Found trawling the GitHub pages of [@apreshill](https://github.com/apreshill).) Many were modified later in Illustrator.
